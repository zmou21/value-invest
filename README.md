# Envest

## Description

A full-stack site, built with node.js that gives users stock recommendations based on value investing philosophy, as well as buy/sell/hold recommendations for companies users select. 

A user has the option to perform a quick search. 
A quick search asks a user to enter a company's ticker and they will receive a breakdown of the stocks current performance and a 30-day chart.
If the user is interested in buy/don't buy recommendations, then they can perform a "deep search" and the will receive the recommendation based on an analysis of the company's intrinsic value.
